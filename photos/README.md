# Photos Directory

This directory contains images for the smart mirror photo slideshow.

## Instructions:

1. Add your favorite photos to this directory
2. Supported formats: JPG, JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP
3. Recommended size: 1920x1080 or smaller for best performance
4. The slideshow will automatically cycle through all images in this folder

## Sample Images:

To get started, you can add some sample images here. The slideshow is configured to:
- Change images every 10 seconds
- Randomize the order
- Show images at 300x200 pixels in the bottom-left corner
- Use smooth transitions between images

## Tips:

- Keep image file sizes reasonable (under 2MB each) for smooth transitions
- Use landscape orientation images for best display
- The module will automatically resize images to fit the configured dimensions
- You can add subdirectories, but make sure to enable `recursiveSubDirectories: true` in the config if needed
